This repository is a trading fund on Kalshi and Polymarket.  First, set up the kalshi and polymarket websockets, refer to the documentations here: https://docs.kalshi.com/welcome, and here https://docs.polymarket.com/market-data/websocket/overview.  Then create a strategies folder implemening three strategies: strategy 1: findthe most profitiable traders on polymarket and copying them.  This requires finding the best users and using the websockets on both markets to trade on them.  Strategy 2: identifying nichier, lower volume, higher spread markets with a clear fair value and low volatility to market make on.  This require identifying markets and then using the websocket to trade on them. Strategy 3: this is the most open ended of all the strategies.  Find source of alt data, e.g. random posts on twitter, satelitte imagery, things that are correlated that people might not assume, etc, and use that data to build a fair value model for niche models on both platforms.  Also, build a simulator to test all of these strategies.
